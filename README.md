# SimplyTasks - v. 1.0

Web application made for simple task management.

# Description

Hobby project made as an exercise.
Frontend stays on Firebase but backend is not yet set up.
Might set the non-safe version later for general usage.

### To do when I get more time to tinker:

> Rebuild for HTTPS when I get a domain and SSL (system already set up, just need cert)
> Add JWT
> Add email registration (system already set up, just need proper HTTPS to do it)
> Add email account confirmation (have an idea)
> Non-confirmed account limited to 10 tasks and deleted in 7 days
> Go crazy with CSS and make it more beautiful than Mona Lisa
